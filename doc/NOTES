###MBED TLS is dual licensed in this *weeeird* way where there's two seperate downloads for GPL version and Apache version.

This one is the best one to use by far. It has configurable option support and it has support for bitcoin curves.
Need to build our own config file and cmake for it


..Salt related options
#define MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_CURVE25519_ENABLED should be added in the config but it's not.
#define MBEDTLS_CHACHA20_C
#define MBEDTLS_POLY1305_C		//needed for SEL implementation
#define MBEDTLS_CHACHAPOLY_C

..performance tweak
#define MBEDTLS_SHA256_SMALLER 

..dev features
#define MBEDTLS_VERSION_FEATURES
#define MBEDTLS_DEBUG_C
#define MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_C
#define MBEDTLS_ERROR_C  //ENABLE IF NEEDED!
#define MBEDTLS_MD_C //generic wrapeprs
#define MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_C //THIS can be used to substitute new definitions for the platform layer.
#MBEDTLS_THREADING_C //needed for multithreaded calls
#define MBEDTLS_VERSION_C
#define MBEDTLS_PKCS5_C  //THIS IS PBKDF2!!!

//#define MBEDTLS_MEMORY_BUFFER_ALLOC_C

..future features
#define MBEDTLS_ASN1_PARSE_C 
#define MBEDTLS_ASN1_WRITE_C	//Maybe for DER?
#define MBEDTLS_BASE64_C		//COOOL but not needed now.
#define MBEDTLS_PEM_PARSE_C
#define MBEDTLS_PEM_WRITE_C
#define MBEDTLS_HMAC_DRBG_C

//#define MBEDTLS_MPI_MAX_SIZE            1024 /**< Maximum number of bytes for usable MPIs. */
This is related to b
NOTES:  gen_key in bignum.c calls gen_prime in bignum.c which calls fill_random.  This is bytes not bits so this is extremely overkill
SRAM restrictions here are pretty goddamned brutal.


#define MBEDTLS_HMAC_DRBG_MAX_SEED_INPUT      256 /**< Maximum size of (re)seed buffer */
